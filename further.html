    <h2 class="subhead">The Civic Campus</h2>
    <p class="fulltext">
    The Mequon Civic Campus includes City Hall, the municipal pool, the Frank L. Weyenburg Library, and Mequon Community Park with Rennicke baseball diamond. The campus begins at the northern edge of Town Center. City Hall has a new plaza that’s used for performances and celebrations, a space for cultural events. The Weyenburg Library hosts readings and performances in a small space.  
    </p>
    <h2 class="subhead"><Mequon Commons></h2>
    <div class="block">
      <p>In 2025, Mequon held meetings to get input on evolving the Civic Campus into Mequon Commons. On September 17th, the community was introduced to five concepts for the space. If this development happens as proposed, it holds the chance that it will create shared public spaces in which people can feel 'in-place'.</p>
