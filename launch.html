    <h2 class="subhead">Ped Friendly?</h2>
    <div class="block">
      <p> WiRED intended the development to be pedestrian friendly. There were sidewalks around the outside of the development. Almost from the start, parking was a limiting factor at Town Center. Mequon expanded a municipal lot adjacent to the development. </p>

      To increase the parking capacity, in 2019, Mequon expanded the parking behind the adjacent city hall to bolster parking.

    <h2 class="subhead">Public Spaces</h2>
    <p class="fulltext">
      Town Center moved toward the goal of creating a signature destination in central Mequon. It offers several third spaces but it has no public space.</p>
    <p class="fulltext">
    Across Cedarburg Road from Town Center, between where Seyfert’s Pharmacy had stood and the Milwaukee River, was a parcel owned by Mequon. It could have been called, charitably, a pocket park but it had no attractive features or amenities. There were two houses between the parcel and a small park to the north.

    <div class="block">
      <p>Mequon and Theinsville commissioned Groth Design Group to develop concepts for ‘Gateway Park’ to retain green space, to welcome visitors to the area, and to establish the Mequon-Thiensville brand. The Mequon Common Council and the Thiensville Village Board looked at three design concepts in April, 2018.</p>

    <div class="block">
      <p>The chosen concept features a curved partition that separates the park from the traffic on the adjacent roads. The road-facing side of the partition includes a logo for the two municipalities and an electronic sign accounting community events. A raised walkway follows the river. 
    </p>

  On the park-facing side of the partition is seating, signage describing the park’s natural features, and rocks for children to scramble over. 
  </p
  <p class="fulltext">
After the two houses were razed, Gateway Park connected to the small park to the north. A boardwalk follows the west bank of the river. It was intended to connect to a large park in Thiensville. Public sentiment resisted the plan.
