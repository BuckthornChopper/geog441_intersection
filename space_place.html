     Unlike Thiensville, and to a much greater degree unlike Cedarburg, Mequon had no center, no clear identity.  
    </p>
    <div class="block">
      <p> The 1959 General Plan, Community Development, Mequon, Wisconsin” said... “Throughout history the heart of the city was its municipal center - the area where government, commerce, entertainment and cultural activity was concentrated. Mequon has been fortunate in having somewhat of a municipal center already established, though expansion demands have already begun to fragment it. Such a center would be a distinct asset to the entire community and one which would help establish a firmer community sense.” </p>

      Today, there are pods of retail activity along arterial streets but no single area that Mequon could call its center. 
    </p>  
    <p class = 'fulltext'>
    The most significant retail area is along Port Washington Road, three miles east of Cedarburg Road.

    <div class="block">
      <p> Growth in that area was nurtured by two TIDs in 2012.</p>

      <p> In 2024, the city commissioned a market analysis of the Port Washington Road area by Redevelopment Resources. The analysis suggested additional paths to greater development.</p>

    There’s a very small strip mall at Mequon Road and Wauwatosa Road, a mile west of Cedarburg Road.
