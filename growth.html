      After World War II, the population of the Town of Mequon grew rapidly. Between 1950 and 1960, it grew 110% to 8,543. It’s estimated today to be over 25,000.

    According to the “2035 Comprehensive Plan for the City of Mequon”, 
    “Mequon community members prefer a balance of urban and rural landscapes by controlling the population and maintaining growth through low density development and managed traffic.” Sounds like it was written by Ebenezer Howard.

    In the late 50s and early 60s, Mequon planners acknowledged the need to deal with the growing population. They acknowledged the need for subdivisions but argued for a more organic structure.

      <p> A Mequon report from 1959 proposes an alternative to large lots which it says cities were forced to adopt to prevent the population from outstripping a city’s resources. The report describes the alternative as ‘...an adaptation of the age old pattern of the European Village, clustered together with open farm land forming a permanent green belt around the homes.’ Per their illustration, it resembles suburban cul du sacs. There are several subdivisions in Mequon with a morphology that looks silimar although most are of the non-rectilinear variety. </p>
