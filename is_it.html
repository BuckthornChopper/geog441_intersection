    <div class="title">Is it a town center?</div>
    <p class="fulltext">
Mequon’s TID 3, which includes the Town Center development plus others to the west along Mequon Road, has certainly increased the tax base of the district. It’s given consumers living in proximity to the development more retail and housing choices. 
    </p>
    <p class="fulltext">
It’s a retail and housing center but does it act like the center of the city as the 1959 planning document suggested that the city needed? The Mequon Commons proposal hews closer to the idea of a town center. 
</p>
<p class="fulltext">
Until Mequon Commons’ cultural and recreational aspects are in place to  complement the Town Center development, I think Town Center is a necessary first step but not a true town center.
